# Network challenges

## FTP - Authentication

When you start the challenge, you will be prompted to download a pcap file. This file contains network traffic captured and stored in a file, and is readable using Packet Sniffers such as Wireshark. Open this file in Wireshark, and you will see FTP packets going back and forth. Looking at the FTP packets, you will find the password since FTP doesn't have encryption.
